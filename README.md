 **Objective**: Analyzed Walmartâ€™s customer spending patterns based on gender, marital status, and age groups using statistical methods.</br>

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:</br>
Handled missing values, removed outliers using percentile clipping, and transformed categorical variables.</br>
Performed data exploration with visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.</br>

**Key Analyses & Findings**:
Confidence Interval Estimation: Calculated 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for male and female spending patterns.</br>
Central Limit Theorem (CLT): Simulated sampling distributions to validate CLT principles and assess confidence interval accuracy.</br>

**Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:</br>
T-tests to compare spending behaviors across different age groups.</br>
Chi-Square Test to analyze gender-wise purchase differences.</br>
Kruskal-Wallis Test to assess spending variations across age segments.</br>

**Insights & Business Recommendations**:</br>
Gender-Based Spending: Male customers spend slightly more than female customers, suggesting targeted promotions for each gender.</br>
</br>
Marital Status & Spending: No significant difference between married and unmarried customers, meaning marketing should focus on product preferences rather than marital status.</br>
</br>
Age Group Spending Trends:</br>
The 0-17 age group has distinct spending behaviour, possibly due to purchases driven by parents.</br>
Young adults (18-25) and middle-aged groups (46-50) show similar spending trends.</br>
Walmart can leverage these insights to adjust product inventory, offer gender-specific promotions, and optimize pricing strategies.</br>
